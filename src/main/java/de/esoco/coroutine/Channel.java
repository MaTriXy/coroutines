/********************************************************************
 * A channel that allows communication between {@link Coroutine Coroutines}. A
 * channel has a fixed capacity and suspends any further sending of data after
 * the capacity has been reached until capacity becomes available again when
 * data is requested by receivers. Receiving will be suspended if no more data
 * is available in a channel.
 *
 * <p>
 * Channels can be queried with the method
 * {@link CoroutineEnvironment#getChannel(ChannelId) getChannel(ChannelId)}
 * which is available in {@link CoroutineScope} and {@link CoroutineContext}. If
 * no channel exists at first access a new channel with a capacity of 1 will be
 * created. A channel with a different capacity can be created with
 * {@link CoroutineEnvironment#createChannel(ChannelId, int)
 * createChannel(ChannelId, int)}, but only if it doesn't exist already.
 * Channels can be removed with
 * {@link CoroutineEnvironment#removeChannel(ChannelId)
 * removeChannel(ChannelId)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a channel is needed for the communication between coroutines in different
 * scopes it needs to be created in a common context of the scopes. If it is
 * only needed in a particular scope it should be created there.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Channels can be closed by invoking {@link #close()}. A closed channel rejects
 * any further send or receive calls by throwing a
 * {@link ChannelClosedException}. Upon a close all pending suspensions will
 * also be failed with that exception.
