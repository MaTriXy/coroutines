/**
 * A scope that manages one or more running coroutines. A new scope is created
 * through the factory method {@link #launch(CoroutineContext, ScopeCode)} It
 * executes an instance of the functional interface {@link ScopeCode} and blocks
 * the invoking thread until the code and all coroutines by it have finished
 * execution (either successfully or with an exception).
 *
 * <p>
 * An alternative way to launch a scope is by using the method
 * {@link #produce(CoroutineContext, Function, ScopeCode)}. It also executes the
 * given code (which in turn may start coroutines) but returns immediately after
 * the code finished with a {@link ScopeFuture} instance. This sub-interface of
 * {@link Future} can then be used to wait for the started coroutines to finish
 * or to cancel the execution. As the name indicates, this method is mainly
 * intended for scope executions that produce result. But it can also be used to
 * just wrap a scope execution to handle it as a future and then ignore the
 * result.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A scope will also automatically close all ({@link AutoCloseable}) resources
 * that are stored in it with relations that have the annotation
 * {@link MetaTypes#MANAGED}.
