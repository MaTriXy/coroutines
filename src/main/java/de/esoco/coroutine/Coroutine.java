/********************************************************************
 * A pure Java implementation of cooperative concurrency, also known as
 * coroutines. Coroutines implement lightweight multiprocessing where all
 * running coroutines share the available execution threads, shortly suspending
 * execution between processing steps to give other coroutines the chance to
 * execute. Furthermore coroutines can suspend their execution indefinitely when
 * waiting for other coroutines or external resources (e.g. data to be sent or
 * received), giving other code the chance to use the available threads.
 *
 * <p>To achieve this functionality, the implementation makes use of several
 * modern Java features of which some are available starting with Java 8. The
 * execution of coroutine steps is done with {@link CompletableFuture} which in
 * turn runs the code by default in the {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool() common
 * thread pool} defined in the {@link ForkJoinPool} class. But if necessary the
 * {@link Executor} used for running coroutines can be changed.</p>
 *
 * <p>To provide a fluent and readable declaration the API makes extensive use
 * of the new functional programming features of Java and the (recommended) use
 * of static imports. By using these, especially by applying lambda expressions
 * and method references, a concise and easily understandable declaration of
 * coroutines is possible.</p>
 *
 * <p>From the outside a coroutine is a function that receives an input value,
 * processes it, and return an output value as the result of the execution. This
 * is similar to the {@link Function} interface introduced with Java 8. If
 * invoked {@link #runBlocking(CoroutineScope) blocking} it will behave exactly
 * like a standard function, blocking the current thread until the processing
 * has finished and the result value has been produced. But if invoked {@link
 * #runAsync(CoroutineScope) asynchronously} the coroutine will be executed in
 * parallel to the current thread, suspending it's execution shortly between
 * processing steps or even pausing until data is available.</p>
 *
 * <p>Besides this Coroutine class there are a few other classes that play an
 * important role in the execution of coroutines:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link CoroutineContext}: coroutines run in a certain context. The
 *     context can either be provided explicitly or else the {@link
 *     Coroutines#getDefaultContext() default context} is used. If different
 *     coroutines need to communicate during their execution they need to run in
 *     the same context. The context can also be used to provide configuration
 *     for the coroutines running in it.</li>
 *   <li>{@link CoroutineScope}: coroutines can only be launched inside a scope.
 *     The scope provides the runtime environment for an arbitrary number of
 *     coroutines. It also serves as a defined entry and exit-point into
 *     coroutine executions: a scope will block execution of the launching
 *     thread until all coroutines in it have finished execution (either
 *     successfully, by cancelation, or with an error). This follows the pattern
 *     of <i>structured concurrency</i> which prevents "forgotten" executions
 *     running in the background or terminating silently with an error. The
 *     scope also provides configuration and shared state for the coroutines in
 *     it, overriding any configuration in the context.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Continuation}: Every execution of a coroutine is associated with
 *     a continuation object that contains the current execution state. It is
 *     local to a single execution and thus not shared with other running
 *     instances of the same or other coroutines.</li>
 *   <li>{@link CoroutineStep}: The base for all steps that can be executed in a
 *     coroutine. Like the coroutine itself it is basically a function that
 *     receives an input value and produces a result. When executing
 *     asynchronously a step implementation can suspend it's execution by
 *     stopping the background execution completely until the condition that
 *     caused the suspension no longer exists (e.g. a resource becomes
 *     available). Several standard steps are defined in the 'step' sub-package
 *     but the base class can also be extended to create new kinds of coroutine
 *     steps.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Suspension}: If a step signals to suspend it's asynchronous
 *     execution a suspension object is created. The suspension contains the
 *     suspended execution state, mainly by referencing the associated {@link
 *     Continuation}. When the suspending condition is resolved the suspension
 *     can be used to resume the asynchronous execution of the coroutine.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Channel}: The previous classes are always involved when building
 *     and executing coroutines. Channels are an optional but important feature
 *     because they allow multiple coroutines to communicate without blocking
 *     their threads. A coroutine will automatically suspend it's execution if a
 *     channel that is used for receiving or sending has no data or capacity
 *     available. As soon as the channel becomes available again the coroutine
 *     will continue to run. Channels are managed by either the scope or the
 *     context the coroutine runs in. If coroutines in different scopes need to
 *     communicate through a channel their scopes need to have the same context
 *     and the channel must be created in the context (not in the scope which is
 *     the default).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A coroutine can either be created by invoking the public {@link
 * #Coroutine(CoroutineStep) constructor} with the first {@link CoroutineStep}
 * to execute or by invoking the factory method {@link #first(CoroutineStep)}.
 * The latter allows to declare a coroutine in a fluent way with better
 * readability. There is a slight limitation caused by the generic type system
 * of Java: if the result of {@link #first(CoroutineStep) first()} is assigned
 * to a variable with a specific input type it may be necessary to declare the
 * input type explicitly in the parameters of a lambda expression. For example,
 * the following example (using a static import of first() may cause a compiler
 * error (depending on the Java version used):</p>
 * <code>Coroutine&lt;String, String&gt; toUpper = first(apply(s ->
 * s.toUpperCase()));</code>
 *
 * <p>To make the code compile, the type of the lambda argument needs to be
 * declared explicitly:</p>
 * <code>Coroutine&lt;String, String&gt; toUpper = first(apply((String s) ->
 * s.toUpperCase()));</code>
 *
 * <p>After a coroutine has been created it can be extended with additional
 * steps by invoking the instance method {@link #then(CoroutineStep)} on it.
 * This method takes the next step to be executed and <b>returns a new coroutine
 * instance</b>. This means that <b>coroutines are immutable</b>, i.e. they
 * cannot be modified after they have been created. Only new coroutines can be
 * created from them. This allows to declare coroutine templates which can be
 * extended by adding additional processing steps without the risk of changing
 * the original. Thus the {@link #first(CoroutineStep) first()} and {@link
 * #then(CoroutineStep) then()} methods implement a builder pattern where each
 * invocation creates a new coroutine instance.</p>
 *
 * <p>The immutability of coroutines initially only covers their code (i.e. the
 * step sequence). The Coroutine class also extends {@link RelatedObject} and
 * therefore allows to set arbitrary relations on it which can be used to
 * configure step behavior or set default data, for example. To also make the
 * relations of an instance immutable (basically sealing the coroutine template)
 * just set the flag relation {@link MetaTypes#IMMUTABLE IMMUTABLE} on it which
 * will prevent the further modification of relations. This flag will not be
 * copied on started coroutines (which are always a copy of the original
 * coroutine). This allows to modify the instances of immutable coroutine
 * templates.</p>
 *
 * <p>When a coroutine is executed a copy of it is created and then associated
 * with a new {@link Continuation} instance. That prevents running code to
 * modify the coroutine (template) it has been started from but gives it access
 * to any of it's relations. The actual runtime state is stored in the
 * continuation object and may be modified freely by the coroutine code. It is
 * recommended that coroutine steps use the continuation if they need to share
 * data with other steps besides the standard input and output parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p>Accessing state in the continuation can be done without further
 * synchronization because the steps in a coroutine are executed sequentially
 * and never concurrently (unless stated otherwise by some special step
 * implementations). But if steps access variables outside the continuation they
 * must apply the same caution like other multi-threaded code in Java because
 * access to such resource may (and will probably) need synchronization to avoid
 * concurrency issues (which are notoriously difficult to debug). This includes
 * {@link CoroutineScope} and {@link CoroutineContext} which are shared by
 * multiple running coroutine instances. There are no synchronization mechanisms
 * for access to the relations in these objects. If a step implementation wants
 * to modify relations in the scope or context it must perform the necessary
 * synchronization itself.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Attention:</b> Any synchronization between coroutines should be applied
 * with caution. Coroutines implement <b>cooperative multi-tasking</b> by
 * executing their steps in a thread pool. These pools assume that the code
 * running in a pool thread only occupies it as long as needed for the
 * processing. Blocking such a thread in some way (like waiting for a lock,
 * accessing a synchronized resource, or just sleeping) counteracts the purpose
 * of the thread pool in particular and of cooperative multi-tasking in general.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Therefore it is strongly advised to not perform "classical"
 * synchronizations from coroutine steps. Instead it should be checked whether
 * it is possible to implement this in a cooperative way by suspending the
 * coroutine execution while waiting for a resource. This can be achieved by
 * using an asynchronous API for accessing a resource, like that provided by the
 * java.nio package (see the sub-package 'step.nio' for examples).</p>
